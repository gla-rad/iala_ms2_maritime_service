# Annex A. IMO User Needs And Priorities

For reference, this annex provides three discrete tables with the user needs and priorities that have been identified in the IMO in MSC.1/Circ.1595, Annex 3 [@cite:imo-msc-1-circ1595-2018]. The tables focus specifically on Shipboard, Shore-based and Search and Rescue (SAR) users respectively. Only the entries that are deemed relevant to the MS-2 Aids to Navigation Service specification have been included.

  <td><strong>User-selectable presentation of information received via communication equipment</strong></td>
  <td>Seafarers expressed a desire to have the possibility to present user-selectable information received via communication equipment on the navigational displays (e.g. ship in distress, wind speed/ direction, AtoN status, restricted areas). They further requested the possibility to filter some transmitted data for presentation according to user-set parameters (e.g. only information from user-selected sea areas).</td>

  </td>
  <td>Research should be conducted regarding the type of information, equipment and systems involved and how to present and/or filter such information.</td>
  <td>Availability of information in real-time with possible presentation on the shipborne navigational displays. Information overload needs to be prevented, therefore, presentation of information should be user-selectable to filter required information. Task-oriented presentation based on INS-tasks (resolution MSC.252(83)).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>Maritime Safety Information (MSI):</strong> Seafarers expressed a desire to sort and display MSI, such as NAVTEX, SafetyNET, more effectively.</td>
  <td><p>On most ships, NAVTEX information is displayed on a separate screen or printed on a scroll of paper. The Latitude and Longitude of the MSI must then be compared to that of the ship by the watchkeeper to identify whether the information is relevant and poses a risk. For example, notifications of new and dangerous wreck carriers are not prioritized over drifting buoys, possibly hundreds of miles away from the ship's intended route.<p></p>This is a very time-consuming and distracting task, and susceptible to human error. Seafarers considered that presenting such safety information on the ship's navigation display would be far more effective and a clear benefit of e-Navigation.</p></td>

  <td>Work with relevant stakeholders to address technical requirements for presenting MSI on shipborne navigation displays. Take note of Methodology for developing e-Navigation user needs using a task-based approach (NAV 55/11/4).</td>
  <td>Possible re-formatting of NAVTEX data and continuing with transmitting data on same frequencies. Transition from old to new format. Task-oriented presentation based on INS-tasks (resolution MSC.252(83)).</td>

<tr>
  <td><strong>Indication of Reliability</strong></td>
  <td>Seafarers have expressed a concern that on systems such as ECDIS, the ship's position is always indicated as an absolute, leaving seafarers to rely on their understanding of technically complex systems to assess the accuracy of such indicated positions. Seafarers have expressed a desire for systems to automatically assess the accuracy and integrity of hydrographic data, position fixing data, radar, and other ship sensors to return a graphical indication of assessment.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>Improved Reliability:</strong> Before seafarers are confident in e-Navigation systems, they must prove far more reliable than many of the present systems.</td>
  <td>Seafarers today often struggle with electronic equipment that fails or malfunctions in some respect. This may relate to poor performance from radar; electronic chart software faults; incorrect AIS data, GMDSS alerts or loss of position fixing systems. Even a 99% reliability rating would result in a problem for 1 voyage in every 100. This has resulted in many seafarers distrusting electronic systems, and now having grave doubts about relying on e-Navigation. It must be recognized that there is little competence for fixing such systems on board, and obtaining the services of a qualified technician in some ports can be difficult.</td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>Effective and robust communication</li>
      <li>Data and system integrity</li>
    </ul>
  </td>
  <td>It will be necessary to carry out an assessment to quantify reliability parameters. To include specific assessment of reliability of electronic position fixing systems.</td>
  <td>Design specification for current equipment. Type approval process. Competence of installation and repair technicians. Better control and visibility of software and hardware updates.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>Reduction of administrative burden and increase use of electronic documentation</strong></td>
  <td>Seafarers expressed the need to reduce the amount of administrative work on board. They also expressed a desire to replace paper information and documentation by electronic means for easy location of information.</td>

    <ul>
      <li>Human-centred presentation needs</li>
      <li>Data and system integrity</li>
    </ul>
  </td>
  <td>Investigate the best way to harmonize and present maritime documentation in an electronic format to improve efficiency and reduce administrative burden.</td>
  <td>Electronic documents should support: easy localization of information (e.g. with the help of a search function); automatic updates (e.g. of Notices to Mariners); possible integration of information from multiple sources; the integration of information in other systems on the bridge (e.g. ECDIS) electronic documents should be printable or be additionally provided as paper version; the need for traceability and ability to audit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>Automated Updating of Baseline Data and Documents:</strong> Seafarers expressed a desire for documents such as charts and voyage planning publications to be automatically updated, with minimal shipboard intervention.</td>
  <td>Seafarers are required to use a plethora of publications associated with voyage planning and monitoring. These include, but are not limited to: charts, lights list, lists of radio signals, sailing directions, port guides, etc. Currently, most of these are kept on board in paper format and require a considerable amount of time to keep constantly updated. Seafarers believe that e-Navigation can be of benefit if it ensures that all these sources of information are automatically maintained up to date, and all of this information is accessible from a centralized location. Seafarers have also expressed a desire for this information to be easy to access, sort and make sense of. This may be achieved by standard formats or smart systems. Seafarers are very concerned that e-Navigation may lead to more information being made available to them, leading to further overburdening. It is essential that the provision of information via e-Navigation should be managed and presented effectively.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>Effective and robust communications</strong></td>
  <td>A clear need was expressed for there to be an effective and robust means of communications for ship and shore users. Shore-based users require an effective means of communicating with ships to facilitate safety, security and environmental protection and to provide operational information. To be effective, communication with and between ships should make best use of audio/visual aids and standard phrases to minimize linguistic challenges and distractions to operators. Research has indicated that a high percentage of seafarers  regard language incompatibility and non-standard phrases as a major problem. They also highlighted equipment failure and busy communication channels a concern that needed to be addressed.</td>
