# Executive Summary

The IMO has since 2010 introduced and promoted e-Navigation as a concept for the migitation of the future challenges of the maritime domain. The IMO e-Navigation Strategy Implementation Plan (SIP) defines a set of Maritime Services (MS) as the means of providing electronic information in a harmonized way. MS-2 - Aids to Navigation Service was introduced, with the aim of promulgating the latest information on AtoN and augment charted AtoN information. This guideline presents the a holistic overview of MS2 from the point of view of IALA.

In the envisaged context, the AtoN information is collected and monotired by the AtoN Authorites, which in collaboration with the Coastal Authorities and the Hydrographic Offices (HO) disseminate it to all interested parties. There are two main flows of the AtoN information towards the final end-uset which is the mariner.For mariners onboard vessels with SOLAS equipment the "official" flow is controlled and quality-assured by the HOs, RENCS, VARs and Distributors/OEMs. For all other mariners, AtoN Authorities can utilised public portals and other ECS providers.

The AtoN information will require a number of technical services to be successfully promulgated in a timely manner, including:

* Aton Service providing AtoN information using S-125

* Enhanced AtoN Servive providing AtoN infomation using S-201

* Navigational Warning Service providing information on AtoN incidents using S-124

* PNT Service using the S-240 product specification

As a whole IALA recognises the following six key objectives for MS2:

* **OBJ1**: Provision of AtoN information service to all end-users.

* **OBJ2**: Provision of AtoN information to other authorities.

* **OBJ3**: Describe physical, virtual and synthetic AtoN.

* **OBJ4**: Deliver the current status and changes of AtoN information.

* **OBJ5**: Supplement charts and nautical publications with accurate “high-quality” AtoN information.

* **OBJ6**: Support the adoption of MASS, supplying up-to-date machine readable AtoN information.

This document identifies a number of individual features and architectural parameters that MS2 need to provide to support these six objectives. The service features are specified from the point of view of each of the involved information producers and consumers, while the architectural parameters are high level guidelines that outline the importance of:

* Focus on the provision of AtoN information

* Use of the S-100 Framework

* Use of established data product specifications

* Secure by design

* Leverage automation

* Data Driven

Finally the document defines 19 functional and 10 non-functiona requiredments, so that the technical service development can take place with clearly identified goals. To support that even more, the document provides a high level description of the AtoN update business process model, as well as the envisaged process on how S-124 and S-125 can be used to promulated urgent AtoN status changes in a timely manner. This is in line with the relevant IALA publications.
