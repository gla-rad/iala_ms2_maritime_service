# Executive Summary

In 2010 the IMO introduced and promoted e-Navigation as a concept for the migitation of the future challenges of the maritime domain. The e-Navigation Strategy Implementation Plan (SIP) defines a set of Maritime Services (MS) as the means of providing electronic information in a harmonized way. The MS-2 - Aids to Navigation Service was introduced, with the aim of promulgating the latest information on AtoN and augment charted AtoN information. This document presents a holistic overview of MS2 from the point of view of IALA.

In the operational context, the AtoN information is collected and monotired by the AtoN Authorites, which in collaboration with the Coastal Authorities and the Hydrographic Offices (HO) disseminate it to all interested parties. There are two main flows of the AtoN information towards the final end-uset which is the mariner. Onboard vessels with SOLAS equipment, the "official" flow is controlled and quality-assured by the HOs, RENCS, VARs and Distributors/OEMs. For all other mariners, AtoN Authorities can utilise public portals and ECS providers.

The AtoN information will require a number of technical services to be successfully promulgated in a timely manner, including, an Aton Information Service providing AtoN information over S-125, an Enhanced AtoN Information Servive providing AtoN infomation over S-201,a Navigational Warning Service providing information on AtoN incidents using S-124, and a PNT Service using the S-240 product specification.

IALA recognises the following six key objectives for MS2:

* **OBJ1**: Provision of AtoN information service to all end-users.

* **OBJ2**: Provision of AtoN information to other authorities.

* **OBJ3**: Describe physical, virtual and synthetic AtoN.

* **OBJ4**: Deliver the current status and changes of AtoN information.

* **OBJ5**: Supplement charts and nautical publications with accurate “high-quality” AtoN information.

* **OBJ6**: Support the adoption of MASS, supplying up-to-date machine readable AtoN information.

IALA identified a number of individual features and architectural parameters that are required for MS2 to support these six objectives. The service features are specified from the point of view of each of the involved information producers and consumers, while the architectural parameters outline the importance of:

* Focus on the provision of AtoN information

* Use of the S-100 Framework

* Use of established data product specifications

* Secure by design

* Leverage automation

* Data Driven

It is noted, that the MS2 can be regarded as an AtoN itself and might need to follow to the IALA-defined AtoN categorisation and availability objectives, as it is designed to support the safety of navigation. This document finally defines 19 functional and 10 non-functiona requiredments, so that the technical service development can proceed with clearly identified goals. A high-level description of the AtoN update business process model is also provided, as well as the envisaged process on how S-124 and S-125 can be used to promulated urgent AtoN status changes in a timely manner, both in line with the relevant IALA documentation.
